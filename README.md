# word2vec-demo
* This is a demo of word2vec skip-gram architecture
  * The sliding window size is 3
  * We use a center word (in one hot vector format) as an input to predict context words (in one hot vector format)
  * After the training is done, the hidden layer can be used as word embeddings and we can observe that similar words will be close to each other in vector space

## How to run
* Open `w2v.html` by browser, and click `Train` button
